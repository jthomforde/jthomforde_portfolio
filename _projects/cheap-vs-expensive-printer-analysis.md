## Project Overview

For my final project in **MAE 3260: System Dynamics**, my group investigated the control behavior of a common household machine: the blender. We analyzed why inexpensive blenders often struggle with consistency and performance compared to high-end systems such as **Ninja** or **Vitamix** models.

## Technical Focus

Our analysis compared **open-loop control** used in low-cost blenders with the **closed-loop feedback control** found in premium machines. We examined:

- Mechanical design and blade assemblies  
- Motor and electrical characteristics  
- System response to varying load conditions  
- The role of feedback in improving torque delivery and blend consistency  

This comparison illustrated how feedback-based motor control allows premium blenders to adapt to changing operating conditions, resulting in smoother operation and more reliable performance.

## Individual Contributions

In our four-person group, all members contributed to the physical teardown and system-level analysis. My primary contributions included:

- Analyzed high-end blender systems to identify common misconceptions about motor power versus control performance  
- Developed block diagram for the expensive system 
- Applied control theory concepts to model blender motor behavior under varying load conditions  
- Led the comparison between open-loop and closed-loop blender architectures, highlighting performance and consistency differences
