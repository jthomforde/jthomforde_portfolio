## Project Overview

My final project for **MAE 3230: Fluid Mechanics** was to perform a fluid-mechanical dissection of a commercial **inkjet printer**. Our team disassembled the printer to study the internal mechanisms and flow paths that control how ink is stored, pressurized, and ejected through the nozzles.  
While the printer is driven largely by mechanical components, the ink cartridges rely on **fluid mechanics** to meter and eject droplets, so we focused on connecting the hardware to key concepts from the course.

## My Contributions

In a group of five, each member focused on different aspects of the system. My main contributions were:

- Investigating **capillary action** inside the cartridge and nozzles  
- Creating **diagrams of the droplet and nozzle stages** throughout the ejection process  
- Helping write the project **script** and structure the main story of the video  
- Assisting with **filming and editing** the final five-minute presentation in iMovie
