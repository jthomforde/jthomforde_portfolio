As the final project for Mechanics of Engineering Materials, we were asked to design a torque wrench by selecting the material and adjusting the dimensions to meet specified requirements. The material we chose to use is a quenched and tempered high-strength, low-alloy steel, or AISI 4340 QT 409. We chose this material because it is durable and delivers a high enough output to meet the requirements. The relevant information about this material is the Young's modulus, tensile strength, fracture toughness, and fatigue strength. These properties are as follows:

Young's Mondulus --> E = 30 * 10^6 psi
Poisson's Ratio --> nu = 0.29 
Tensile strength --> su = 210 ksi
Fracture toughness --> KIC = 77 (ksi sqrt(in))
Fatigue stress for 10^6 cycles --> sfatigue = 95 *10^3

The design rendering is very simple geometry, as shown below.
