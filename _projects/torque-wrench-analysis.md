The RFP Web Scraper features a user-friendly GUI that performs four key functions to monitor space-related contract opportunities. It continuously collects and displays a dataset of 240–250 active Requests for Proposals (RFPs), scraped from three main sources: NASA JPL, NASA ROSES, and Instant Market  Space Industry.

The interface enables users to:

- Check for new RFPs added since the last scrape
- Filter RFPs by due date, showing only those due within a selected number of weeks
- Search by keyword, allowing users to quickly locate relevant opportunities within the dataset

This tool streamlines the process of tracking open solicitations in the aerospace sector, making it easy to monitor hundreds of RFPs in one place.
