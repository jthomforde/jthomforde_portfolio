My final project for **MAE 3230: Fluid Mechanics** was to perform a fluid mechanical dissection on a machine.  
My group was assigned an inkjet printer. We took apart the printer and observed the inner workings of its
mechanisms. While the printer is driven largely by mechanical components, the ink cartridges rely on fluid
mechanics to dispense the ink through the nozzles.

We created a five-minute video explaining how an inkjet printer works, highlighting key equations and concepts.  
In our group of five members, I focused on:

- Investigating capillary action inside the cartridge and nozzles  
- Creating diagrams of the different nozzle stages  
- Helping write the script and edit the final video

Below is a photo from our presentation and the final project video.
