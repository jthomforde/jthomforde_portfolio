## Project Overview

My final project for **MAE 3230: Fluid Mechanics** was to perform a fluid-mechanical dissection of a machine.  
Our group was assigned an inkjet printer, which we took apart to study the internal mechanisms and flow paths.

While the printer is driven largely by mechanical components, the ink cartridges rely on **fluid mechanics** to meter and eject droplets through the nozzles. We created a five-minute video explaining how an inkjet printer works, highlighting the key governing equations and concepts from the course.

## My Contributions

In a group of five, we each focused on different aspects of the system. My main contributions were:

- Investigating **capillary action** inside the ink cartridge and nozzle
- Creating **diagrams of the different nozzle stages** throughout the droplet ejection process
- Helping write the **script** and structure the main story of the video
- Assisting with **filming and editing** the final presentation video
