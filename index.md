## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
I’m a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University exploring the intersection of engineering, software, and strategy. I enjoy building systems, whether they’re physical, data-driven, or organizational, and turning complex problems into, functional solutions.

I’ve worked on projects ranging from satellite automation and embedded systems to web-based business tools and robotics workflows. My experience spans aerospace, data-driven automation, and product-focused engineering environments, where I’ve developed a strong foundation in mechanical design, software development, and technical problem solving.
